	abstract = {This paper presents the main objectives and a description of the SU2 suite, including the novel software architecture and open-source software engineering strategy. SU2 is a computational analysis and design package that has been developed to solve multiphysics analysis and optimization tasks using unstructured mesh topologies. Its unique architecture is well suited for extensibility to treat partial-differential-equation-based problems not initially envisioned. The common framework adopted enables the rapid implementation of new physics packages that can be tightly coupled to form a powerful ensemble of analysis tools to address complex problems facing many engineering communities. The framework is demonstrated on a number, solving both the flow and adjoint systems of equations to provide a high-fidelity predictive capability and sensitivity information that can be used for optimal shape design using a gradient-based framework, goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement, or uncertainty quantification.},

	abstract = {Many quantum algorithms, such as the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, depend on oracles that efficiently encode classical data into a quantum state. The encoding of the data can be categorized into two types: analog encoding, where the data are stored as amplitudes of a state, and digital encoding, where they are stored as qubit strings. The former has been utilized to process classical data in an exponentially large space of a quantum system, whereas the latter is required to perform arithmetics on a quantum computer. Quantum algorithms such as HHL achieve quantum speedups with a sophisticated use of these two encodings. In this work, we present algorithms that convert these two encodings to one another. While quantum digital-to-analog conversions have implicitly been used in existing quantum algorithms, we reformulate it and give a generalized protocol that works probabilistically. On the other hand, we propose a deterministic algorithm that performs a quantum analog-to-digital conversion. These algorithms can be utilized to realize high-level quantum algorithms such as a nonlinear transformation of amplitudes of a quantum state. As an example, we construct a “quantum amplitude perceptron,” a quantum version of the neural network that hence has a possible application in the area of quantum machine learning.},

	abstract = {We show that a set of gates that consists of all one-bit quantum gates [U(2)] and the two-bit exclusive-OR gate [that maps Boolean values (x,y) to (x,x⊕y)] is universal in the sense that all unitary operations on arbitrarily many bits n [U(2n)] can be expressed as compositions of these gates. We investigate the number of the above gates required to implement other gates, such as generalized Deutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2) transformation to one input bit if and only if the logical and of all remaining input bits is satisfied. These gates play a central role in many proposed constructions of quantum computational networks. We derive upper and lower bounds on the exact number of elementary gates required to build up a variety of two- and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number required for n-bit Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some observations about the number required for arbitrary n-bit unitary operations.},
